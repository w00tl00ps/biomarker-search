# CCO Biomarker Search

The objective of this app is to create a search of funded CCO biomarker tests as published on the [CCO website](https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/cancer-care-ontario/programs/clinical-services/pathology-laboratory-medicine).

This web application solely retrieves publicly accessible data and does not store, collect, or have access to any personally identifiable or sensitive health information.

## Built with

1. SvelteKit
2. TailwindCSS
3. DaisyUI
4. MongoDB
5. Vercel

## Key Features and App Design

1. Search From
	1. Simple textbox for text search
	2. Advanced filters: by organ site, by testing site
	3. Highlight if test funded or not
2. Display the search results with expandable details for each result
3. Data is retreived from a MongoDB database

### MongoDB Configuration

The connection to the MongoDB is defined in a `.env` file with the following fields:
```bash
MONGO_URL = URL + credentials to the MongoDB
MONGO_DB = the name of the database to connect to
```

Currently, the name of the collection inside the database must be called "biomarkers".

### MongoDB Data Structure Format

The data is currently stored in the following format. (Not all fields are currently being used in the app).

## Design Roadmap

To-Do list of features to implement:
 - [ ] Sort testing sites by distance to the in-house institution

 Build out search capability
 - [x] Handle text based search from a textbox
 - [x] Serve results to a simple component

Completed tasks:
 - [x] Build link to MongoDB and a simple query
 - [x] Server query results to a page with basic formatting
 - [x] Build API endpoints for queries to support search capability
	 - [x] Build `/api/biomarkers`
		 - [x] Search string capability
		 - [x] Allow for filtering by organSite
 - [x] Highlight important keywords within the testing indication to improve clarity (e.g. "reflex testing")
   - [x] Emphasis on "Reflex Testing" 
 - [x] Allow for selecting and filtering by testing site
 - [x] Show a list of most recently updated / added tests (based on CCO Funded Date)
